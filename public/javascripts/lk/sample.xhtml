    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <i>Sun Labs Lively Kernel</i> a highly dynamic web programming environment
    built around JavaScript, asynchronous networking and other existing web
    technologies.  Lively Kernel and applications built for it are intended
    to run in a regular web browser with no installation or plug-in components
    whatsoever.  The system even includes development tools that allow JavaScript 
    applications to be inspected and modified from within the system itself.
    In this tutorial we provide a step-by-step summary of the main features of the system.
    <p />
    Note that Lively Kernel applications aren't usally run inside
    HTML web pages.  However, in this tutorial we have used the 
    conventional HTML format so that the features of the system
    can be viewed also by people who do not have a compatible web browser.
    <p />
    In order to run all the examples properly, you will need a compatible
    web browser such as Apple Safari 3.0 or Mozilla Firefox 3.0.
    For best viewing experience and performance, 
    <span style="color:red"><b>we recommend Safari 3.0</b></span>.
    With Mozilla Firefox,
    many of the features still don't work fully, and the
    performance of the system may be inadequate. 
    Note that Lively Kernel currently <b>doesn't</b>
    run in Microsoft Internet Explorer.  We hope to have
    support for Internet Explorer available soon.
